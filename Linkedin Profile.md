### [Five Jars](https://fivejars.com/directories) _(US)_

- Spooky Nook Sports recently transitioned to a new CRM system and identified various areas for improvement. Especially the UX design and the user journeys required an update to align with the overall desired website experience. Five Jars was hired to analyze the current state, identify areas for improvement and, eventually, integrate the required third-party functionalities.

- We have launched a calendar and schedules widgets on the website that are constantly syncing with the ACTIVENet CRM and display up-to-date information about all available events. In order to achieve a seamless and intuitive solution, we analyzed the current state of the CRM transition and anticipated the near-future changes to the data structure. We ultimately went live in a phased way to ensure a smooth roll-out of our solution.

### Hired Reason

Without having done any major update to their old website, their technology environment became outdated and error-prone.
We was hired to help them achieve this mission online – through an overhaul of their website and by integrating sophisticated, new functions

### What did we do.

| <center>TimeLine</center> | <center>pages</center>       | <center>session duration</center> | <center>bounce rate</center> |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| <center>7 weeks</center>  | <center>3200 -> 400</center> | <center>+10 %</center>            | <center>40% -> 35%</center>  |

We migrated and overhauled an existing website to harness the power of sophisticated functionalities such as single sign-on and data analytics. One of the overarching goals, however, was to foster efficient updating in the future. Therefore, We created synergies wherever possible and created an intuitive user interface as well as a backend to simplify all processes.

### WorkFlow (A new user interface facilitating interaction)

At the very beginning of this journey, We had been assessing the user requirements and the user journeys. With this understanding of what the client and its users expect as well as how they use the platform, we have chosen a ready-made theme of the Open Y environment and adapted it to the client’s and users’ requirements. By choosing a readily available theme, We was able to fulfill the budget constraint of YMCA of Pierce and Kitsap Counties while offering their users the most sophisticated user interface possible.

### Project Structure

Earlier, the website had over 3,200 pages, and it was quite difficult to manage. We significantly simplified the structure of the website. Now it supports nine community centers, a virtual experience platform, and several offices, including the association’s office, the Center for Community Impact, child care offices, and a recent news page making content editing easier.

### Achievement

- Improved user-centricity across the online presence
- Customized theme implementation below maximum budget
- Made mobile-friendly website
